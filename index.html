            <img src="./assets/resource/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg" alt="Ada Lovelace">
            <p>Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815 in London - November 27, 1852 in Marlybon, United Kingdom) was an English mathematician. This lady, a mathematician by profession, is famous for writing the first program in history. Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first program for the computing machine invented by Charles Babbage, is considered the first programmer in the world's history. This lady also used the terms "cycle" and "working room" for the first time. In 1979-1980, the Ada programming language was created by order of the US Department of Defense. The main goal in creating the language was to create a special system for managing military objects (ships, planes, missiles, tanks, etc.). On February 17, 1983, the ADA object-oriented programming language was officially standardized by ANSI. This language was developed as part of a project adopted by the US Department of Defense to create a single programming language for military systems and large military computers. In addition, the Ada award was established in 1998 in order to perpetuate the name of this lady who was the first programmer.</p>
